Instant and customizable
WhatsChart works instantly! One click and off you go! Additionally, WhatsChart is highly customizable and new customization options are still being added.

How to use?

Export your WhatsApp chats
Open the chat.
Tap More options > More > Export chat.
Choose to export with media. If you decide to leave media out, you won't get statistics about media like pictures, videos etc.
File with name like `chat.txt` or `WhatsApp chat with John.txt` is the file you'll need. WhatsApp unfortunately doesn't follow a consistent pattern while naming the chat file. If a `zip` file was exported, unzip it to find the `.txt` chat file. Feel free to discard the exported media.
If you're still having trouble exporting your chats, refer to the following links from WhatsApp FAQ:
Android
iPhone
